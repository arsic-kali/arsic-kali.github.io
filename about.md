I'm Arsic, a passionate hacker and cybersecurity enthusiast, always looking to push my skills further. I love building and sharing tools, competing on Hack The Box, and constantly learning new ways to break and secure systems. Whether I’m diving into vulnerabilities, automating exploits, or exploring the latest security research, my goal is simple — get better every day and share what I learn with the community. On this GitHub Page site you can find some of my notes, writeups and projects!
